# My-2024: The Good, bad and Ugly

Started the year with a lot of goals and aspirations in all aspects of life including spiritual, physical, carrer and financial. All goals and it was a kick off since the 2024 race has started. 

I had promised my boss the previous year that i would be working for him to build his software product to completion. on the 3rd day  of january i left Ibadan down to Ile Ife to join my boss in developing the software.

My plan was complete the software project and dive straight to content creation and focus on creating tech content because i felt that was money making part of tech and the what was the only i could get recognized and probably get  a job. 

I resumed working for my boss 8th january, 2024. I was working on both the backend and frontend programming simultaneously. It was interesting ride. We implemented interesting features and opened my eyes to writing custom codes. The plan was the ship the first version of the software by first week of February because as at that time we were both running out of cash.

Working on the project was more of a learning experience for me. I developed affection for the project because it was utilizes some deep part of node.js.  work was going on night and day and it got to a stage were we need to now start designing of pages on the frontend for users to interact with. All we working on frontend was just  sending of information to the backend  and getting information from the backend. 

My boss is normally not used to writing code for frontend design as he was more of a backend developer than a frontend developer. So he knew his way around creating by looking for websites with lovely landing pages. He would go ahead to scrape it and add it to the frontend page. 

He scraped all pages from a website that implemented something related to ours and he handed me all the pages to fix them into react. I got the pages and i started fixing them into react. Along the line i ran into a problem and really didn't want to ask hime wat i should do. so i resolve to design the exact page myself instead of using the pages scrapped. That is where the problem started because immediately he handed me those pages. He left office for home and didn't return until a week after. When he came back, he asked how far with the work and i told him i had just finished a landing page. He felt like i was lazy since he had already scrapped the pages. All that was left for me was to just fix them into React. I was feeling like i have done a lot of work because the landing looked complex and i had to write all the code for it. 

My boss started shouting and i had to explain that i ran into a problem while fixing and i decided i was just going to write only the code instead of fixing the already scrapped code. We went through the problem together and discovered the scrapped code  wouldn't work and he decided we manually scraped it. This time it worked and all was fine. 

There was a part of the code that was consuming memory as the remote server we would be deploying on was just 
2GB of ram. I'm in experienced in solving the problem so my boss decided to checking what he could do. He found a solution to it and we were fine.

On a fateful Wednesday morning  the 31st of January 2024 i was rebelious to my boss instruction and he decided i shouldn't work with him on his project. I was very much sorry but i guess it was too late. It pained me becuase I had some much understood the scope of the  project and all. Infact, I had developed affection for the project. I had to stop anyways.

While i stopped, I was thinking of what next to do and i remeber i needed to write a technical content to be published on DEv.to on Data structures and algorithms. I quickly dived into it.
