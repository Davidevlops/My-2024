# My-2024: The Good, bad and Ugly

Started the year with a lot of goals and aspirations in all aspects of life including spiritual, carrer and financial. All goals and it was a kick off since the 2024 race had started. 

I had promised my boss  (more like a brother) the previous year that i would be working for him to build his software product to completion. on the 3rd day  of january i left Ibadan down to Ile Ife to join my boss in developing the software.

My plan was complete the software project and dive straight to content creation with a focus on creating tech content because i felt that was money making part of tech and the what was the only i could quickly get recognized as a devloper and probably get a job. 

I resumed working for my boss 8th january, 2024. We were only two on the project so we were working on both the backend and frontend programming simultaneously. It was interesting ride because it gave me opportunity to implement interesting features. The plan was to ship the first version of the software by first week of February because as at that time boss was   running out of cash and needed to get our first subscribers to the service.

Working on the project was more of a learning experience for me. I developed affection for the project because it utilized some deep part of node.js.  work was going on night and day and it got to a stage were we need to now start designing frontend pages. All we had been working on, on frontend was just sending of all important requests to the backend and getting information from the backend. We needed to design beautiful frontend pages.

My boss is normally not used to coding frontend design as he was more of a backend developer than a frontend developer. So he knew his way around getting already coded design to fit his need and. He would go ahead to customize it to fit his needs. 

He got all the pages from a website that implemented something related to what we were building. He handed me all the pages to fix them into react. I got the pages and i started fixing them into a react app. Along the line i ran into a problem and really didn't want to inform him. so i resolve to code the exact page myself instead of using the pages he got. That is where the problem started because immediately he handed me those pages. He left office for home and didn't return until a week after. 

He went home because he needed to think clearly on one of the problem the backend app was experiencing. There was a part of the code that was consuming memory as the remote server we would be deploying on was just 
2GB of ram. I'm in experienced in solving the problem so my boss decided to checking what he could do. He finally solve the problem and came back to office. On his arrival, he asked how far with the  fronetend designs i had been working on. I told him i had just finished a landing page. He felt like i was lazy since he had gotten the pages and all i was to do was to fix the page in react. I also was feeling like i have done a lot of work because  i had to code those designs instead of fixing the the already gotten designs. Those designs were complex to implement and i had to write all the code for it. 

My boss became angry and i had to explain that i ran into a problem while fixing the designs he gave me. Which i decided i was just going to write only the code instead of fixing the already scrapped code. We went through the problem together and discovered the goteen designs had some problems would not work and he decided we manually get it. This time it worked and all was fine. 

On a fateful Wednesday morning the 31st of January 2024 i was rebelious to my boss instruction and he decided i shouldn't work with him on his project. I was very much sorry but i guess it was too late. It was a bad experience for me becuase I had so much affection for the project. I had to stop anyways.

While i stopped, I was thinking of what next to do and i remebered that i needed to write some technical articles to be published on DEV.to on Data structures and algorithms. I quickly dived into it. it was interesting. From there i noticed i developed passion for explaining concepts. i wrote on big O notation a topic under Data structures and algorithms was very explanatory.

After a week of i stopped working, I decided to carry my luggages and travel back to Ibadan as against my plan. I couldn't believe i can ever come back home to start living with my parents.

After 2 days of staying at home doing nothing and there was no electricity power supply to work on my laptop i decided i wanted to go and use electricity at the University of Ibadan. On getting there, my former roommate who is doing his masters at the University of Ibadan told me help him in his software project assesment of which he needed to be able to graduate from his online training tech school. I jumped on it since i had no software project that i was working on, i just wanted write code. The amazing thing was that, throughout that day i was busy on project till i discovered it was late in the night and i couldn't go home. 

The time i was called upon to check my time is when i knew time had passed. I haven't finished with the project because the project was big enough it was a blog app. I promised i would continue tommorrow and I was about going home when i discoverd i can't as it was too late. I called One of my boss friend who was also doing his masters at University of Ibadan that could I pass the night at his place and i Obliged i went  there and discoverd i wasn't even around but told his roommate to come pick me. He picked me, I went to room and slept. At around 6AM, I woke and set out to continue my coding at Student Union Building. 

I continued all through the day and that was how the former roomate told me to come to his room as he had an empty bed. I jumped on it as i really didn't want to go home. there was no electricity. There's really no point going home. I wrote a lot code that made feel like i must make it this year.


I was writing this code on his system because his system had a longer battery life and it was a 16GB of ram which made work faster. i got so familiar withis sytem because it was fast and made it enjoy my programming experience. All of a sudden I was feeling the need to get an extra ram on my system to upgrade it's capacity.


After, I had completed the project to a milestone after three consecutive days. I decided to go home and rest. I promised to be back in two days time. While i was going home i was feeling the need to quickly get a job that would enable upgrade my ram from 4GB to about 16GB. I thought within myself that i needed to get a teaching job as i knew teaching job are usually easy to see and also i wanted a school that constant power supply where i could charge my laptop and use it when i have a free period.

I just took a step and went to apply to one of the best schools with the facilities i wanted if they needed a teacher. As at that time, the term was about coming to an end and under normal circumstance they shouldn't need a teacher. In my application, i listed some subjects i could teach and to my greatest surprise, I was told to come next week for an exam. I wrote the exam and was called for an interview. I did well and by the end of February ending, I was told to resume work first week of march. I was very happy as this would give me the opportunity to use part of salary to buy a ram into my system.

After a month, I got my salary and purchased the amount of ram i wanted. I had become comfortable with the school library as that was one of places i could write code without disturbance.
fortunately for me, I was the English Language teacher of the school. I taught the student well. They liked me as i was the youngest and approachable teacher in the school. I treated them like my younger brothers and sisters.

The School normally closes by 3:30pm but i noticed the principal was always leaving school late as he was faced with administrative work. I utilized that opportunity to code more and also charge my laptop. Most times, I left  the school around 7PM everyday even though school activities ends by 3:30. I was working on a personal project that i felt could be life changing to my current financial status.

Around April I had completed the project with everything wworking fine. I got the information i was looking for but i wanted the information i got to get a personal information. The personal information i have no access to. I decided to use an API. In use the API, I discovered the information wasn't totally credible. At that i lost hope on the project and started researching which API could work better. I did that throughout the whole April as we were on holidays but i was still coming to school mainly to get access to power to charge my phone. I finally discovered API which worked well and was getting the the personal details of the information i had. I started the application of using the personal details but it didn't work the way i expected. 

All these i was tring to solve while i got from a call from a friend of mine asking if i could recommend someone to work on a frontend project. Normally, I don't do frontend but i needed some bucks. He connected me to the honourable that owns the project. I chatted and we agreed price. I told him i would do it. He sent the protype on figma. It was an animated page I gave him a deadline of 2 weeks and I disappeared. The truth was that i could finish it in four days but i didn't trust NEPA so i just told him 2 weeks. I was chilling on the project and two days to the deadline of the project i hosted it for them to see it. It was all done just some few corrections and i completed project.

I had a strong conviction that i needed to use this money for something else i didn't plan for and i used it. I just took the money and did what gave me fulfillment. I continued working in the school and working on my laptop everyday. it was interesting

Fast forward to June, we had a mid term break in school and i had to go to UI to use electricity as no one would be available in school. i was all about meeting my financial goal for the first half of the year. Trying so hard to get a gig on any of freelance platform. I spent three consecutive days not having my bath or brushing my teeth working straight on my laptop. I was just looking and applying to opportunities.

I left UI on Saturday evening just to come home to prepare for church the following day which also doubles as sallah.
On the Sunday, I woke up late for church but tried everything possible to be in church and immediately service ended i left church to come home to sleep. I had slept and woken up. I came back to my system to check my Linkedin account. On checking my Linkedin, I saw an opportunity for a gig for the amount to complete my financial goal for the first half of the year. I applied through my mail and i got a response. We agreed on the next day for an interview. The day came and I did the interview. The guy who interviewed got back to me that i was chosen for the final interview to meet with the CEO on that Friday so that he could award tha gig to me. He also told me that I should prepare more on cloud computing emphasizing AWS. I was like i had used some services on AWS so it is something not really new.

Friday the day of interview came. I met the CEO, a Nigerian based in Germany. I introduced myself and we were cool. He asked the first question of deploying to AWS on EC2 I was wowed because i had read something like that the previous day but i wasn't experienced with using it. I only used AWS lambda instead. He said no problem he asked me the next question, I misunderstood him, which made him to re-emphazise the question again. After the emphasis, I was able to answer the question correctly. He asked another again It took me a long time before i could answer the question of which he assumed i was checking the answer from somewhere. He said for this reason he wouldn't continue the interview with me. I was very pained because i missed a gig that would completed my financial goal for the first half of the year. This was really one of the bad experiences i had.

I learnt a lot from my errors and i promised myself i would do better next time. Around August, I got a message from the guy who introduced me to his Nigeria CEO based in Germany of which i didn't pass the CEO's interview. The guy wanted me to build something amazing. I told him the amount he was offering was relatively low. He said it was just an internship. Since i was jobless and felt like diving into reverse engineering some of the apps that had the features he wanted, I decided to jump on the project. I got some hack about the project and i dived in.

To fully concentrate on his project, I had to resign at the school i teaching around september because i'm really not good at multitasking. Moreover, his project was too demanding.

Focusing on the project was one the ugliest mistakes i made as i later discovered the guy dosen't really knows what he wants. I was both the software architect of the project and at the time the tech lead. I had planned how many algorithms would be written and many times he would come suggesting another kind of solution that isn't robust. I would explain to him that i had properly thought about my solution and the trade offs rather than his solution but he wanted something fast. It became painful but i persevered.


In the middle of the month of October, The national grid was down and i needed to complete a part of the web app as i would be giving a report on it the friday of that week so i decided to go to University of Ibadan to use power I got to UI and i wasn't disspointed as they had light.
I worked all through the night and around 5:30 am I decided to take a break from working while i was still charging my phone right in front of me. I had become so comfortable that i decided to rest my head. while I was dozing not knowing everyone that we spent the night together had left. I was still dozing and someone came him and picked my phone. not quite long after I woke up and noticed my phone was missing. It quickly rush downstairs to get someone tp ring my phone. My phone was ringing but no one picked. I was ringing the phone consistently until a man picked the phone and told me he would return the phone that was far away. I knew it was a lie as this is usually what they alter. Immediately i was thinking on how to get my sim blecked and every important information. I contacted my Mum that I would be coming to her place of to get transport fare to MTN office to retrieve my line. I did that almost immediately and started using an abandoned smartphone that was  in the house. This is an ugly experience for as i was at the end of the month i was told to halt work and wasn't paid a full salary.

I took up a tutorial job just to have some cash saved before going for NYSC. I did this and it really helped as I was independent all through my camp.
