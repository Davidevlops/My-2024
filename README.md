# My-2024: The Good, bad and Ugly

Started the year with a lot of goals and aspirations in all aspects of life including spiritual, physical, carrer and financial. All goals and it was a kick off since the 2024 race has started. 

I had promised my boss the previous year that i would be working for him to build his software product to completion. on the 3rd day  of january i left Ibadan down to Ile Ife to join my boss in developing the software.

My plan was complete the software project and dive straight to content creation and focus on creating tech content
