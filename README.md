# My-2024: The Good, bad and Ugly

Started the year with a lot of goals and aspirations in all aspects of life including spiritual, physical, carrer and financial. All goals and it was a kick off since the 2024 race has started. 

I had promised my boss the previous year that i would be working for him to build his software product to completion. on the 3rd day  of january i left Ibadan down to Ile Ife to join my boss in developing the software.

My plan was complete the software project and dive straight to content creation and focus on creating tech content because i felt that was money making part of tech and the what was the only i could get recognized and probably get  a job. 

I resumed working for my boss 8th january, 2024. I was working on both the backend and frontend programming simultaneously. It was interesting ride. We implemented interesting features and opened my eyes to writing custom codes. The plan was the ship the first version of the software by first week of February because as at that time we were both running out of cash.

Working on the project was more of a learning experience for me. I developed affection for the project because it was utilizes some deep part of node.js.  work was going on night and day and it got to a stage were we need to now start designing of pages on the frontend for users to interact with. All we working on frontend was just  sending of information to the backend  and getting information from the backend. 

My boss is normally not used to writing code for frontend design as he was more of a backend developer than a frontend developer. So he knew his way around creating by looking for websites with lovely landing pages. He would go ahead to scrape it and add it to the frontend page. 

He scraped all pages from a website that implemented something related to ours and he handed me all the pages to fix them into react. I got the pages and i started fixing them into react. Along the line i ran into a problem and really didn't want to ask hime wat i should do. so i resolve to design the exact page myself instead of using the pages scrapped. That is where the problem started because immediately he handed me those pages. He left office for home and didn't return until a week after. When he came back, he asked how far with the work and i told him i had just finished a landing page. He felt like i was lazy since he had already scrapped the pages. All that was left for me was to just fix them into React. I was feeling like i have done a lot of work because the landing looked complex and i had to write all the code for it. 

My boss started shouting and i had to explain that i ran into a problem while fixing and i decided i was just going to write only the code instead of fixing the already scrapped code. We went through the problem together and discovered the scrapped code  wouldn't work and he decided we manually scraped it. This time it worked and all was fine. 

There was a part of the code that was consuming memory as the remote server we would be deploying on was just 
2GB of ram. I'm in experienced in solving the problem so my boss decided to checking what he could do. He found a solution to it and we were fine.

On a fateful Wednesday morning  the 31st of January 2024 i was rebelious to my boss instruction and he decided i shouldn't work with him on his project. I was very much sorry but i guess it was too late. It pained me becuase I had some much understood the scope of the  project and all. Infact, I had developed affection for the project. I had to stop anyways.

While i stopped, I was thinking of what next to do and i remeber i needed to write a technical content to be published on DEv.to on Data structures and algorithms. I quickly dived into it. it was interesting and from there i noticed i developed passion for teaxhing because the article i wote on big O notation a topic under Data structures and algorithms was very explanatory.

After a week of Termination I decided to carry my luggages and set home as against my plan. I couldn't believe i can ever come back home to start living with my parents.

After 2 days of staying at home doing nothing and there was no electricity to work on my laptop i decided i wanted to go and use electricity in University of Ibadan. On getting there, my former roommate who is doing his masters in University of Ibadan told me help him in his project assesment of which he needed to be able to graduate from his tech school. I jumped on it since i had no work doing, i just wanted write code. The amazing thing was that i didn't know time as gone as i was deeply engrossed in the project.

The time i was called upon to check my time is when i knew time had passed. I haven't finished with the project because the project was big enough it was a blog app. I promised i would continue tommorrow and I was about going home when i discoverd i can't as it was too late. I called One of my boss friend who was also doing his masters at University of Ibadan that could I pass the night at his place and i Obliged i went  there and discoverd i wasn't even around but told his roommate to come pick me. He picked me, I went to room and slept. At around 6AM, I woke and set out to continue my coding at Student Union Building. 

I continued all through the day and that was how the former roomate told me to come to his room as he had an empty bed. I jumped on it as i really didn't want to go home. there was no light. There's really no point going home. I wrote a lot code that made feel like i must make it this year.


I was writing this code on his system because his system had a longer battery life and it was a 16GB of ram which made work faster. i got so familiar withis sytem because it was fast and made it enjoy my programming experience. All of a sudden I was feeling the need to get an extra ram on my system to upgrade it's capacity.


After, I had completed the project to a milestone after three consecutive days. I decided to go home and rest. I promised to be back in two days time. While i was going home i was feeling the need for extra job that would enable upgrade my ram from 4GB to about 16GB. I thought within myself that i needed to get a Teaching job as that is usually easy to see and also i wanted to get a teaching job where i could be able to charge and use my laptop anytime I have a free period.

I just take a step and went to apply to one of the best schools with the facilities i wanted if the needed a teacher. As at that time, the term was about coming to an end and under normal circumstance they shouldn't need a teacher. I put a list of subject i could teach and to my greatest surprise, I was told to come nect week for an exam. I wrote the exam and was called for an interview. I did well and by the end of February ending, I was told to resume work first week of march. I was very happy as this would give me the opportunity to use part of salary to buy a ram into my system. 

I taught the student well. They liked me as i was the youngest teacher in the school. I treated them like my younger brothers and sisters.

Also, I had the opportunity of always charging my laptop anytime. I so loved coding to the extent that i would leave school by 7PM everyday even though school  activities ends by 3:30. I would code till around 7pm and go home only to sleep and eat. This became a normal habit for me.

Around April I had to scrape important information on linkedIn of which i wrote an automation to be able to navigate pages and scrape the information. It was very interesting. I solved very complex problems and I just felt like i won't create website again and just stay on automation.

But May 9th, 2024 changed the game as a got a call from a friend of mine asking if i could help developing a landing page that he protyped on figma. I felt like dude you know I'm more of a backend person but right now that am out of gigs, I could run it. 

He connected me to the honourable that owns the project. I chatted and we discussed price. It was just landing page though more of animated pages. I needed money so i took the gig. I gave him a deadline of 2 weeks and I disappeared. The truth was that i could finish it in four days but i didn't trust NEPA so i just told him 2 weeks. I was chilling on the project and on two days to the deadline of the project i hosted it for them to see it. It was all done just some few corrections and i completed project.

I was still working in this school and really i had a dream of which i felt i needed to sow this money somewhere. It was like i had spent the money so i just took the money and did what gave me fulfillment.

Fast forward to June, we had a mid term in school and i had to go to UI to use as  light usual. i was all about meeting my financial goal for the first half of the year. Trying so hard to get a gig on any of freelance platform. I spent three consecutive days not having my bath or brushing my teeth. I was just busy on my laptop looking and applying to opportunities.

I left on Saturday evening just come home to prepare for church the following day  which also doubles as sallah.
On the Sunday, I woke up late for church but tried everything possible to be in church and immediately service ended i left church to come home to sleep. I rslept and woke up. I camm back to my system to check my Linkedin account. On checking my Linkedin, I saw an opportunity for a gig for the amount to complete my financial for the first half of the year. I applied through my mail and i got a response. We agreed on the next day for an interview. The day came and I did the interview. The guy interviewed got back to me that i was chosen for the gig but would need to meet with the CEO on that Friday so that he could award tha gig to me. He also told me that I should prepare more on cloud computing emphasizing AWS. I was like i had used some services on AWS so it is something not really new.

Friday came the day of interview. I met the boss a Nigerian based in Germany. I introduced myself and we were cool. He bears my name and i was feeling like okay let's go. He asked the first question of deploying to AWS on EC2 I was like I'm not exxperienced using EC2 and I told him I had use Lambda instead. He said no problem he asked me the next question, I misunderstoos him he now emphazised the question i answered it correctly. He asked another again It took me a long time before i could answer and he assumed i still checking tjhe answer from somewhere. He said for this reason he wouldn't continue the interview with me. It so much pained me as i missed a gig that would completed my financial goal for the first half of the year. This was really one of the bad experiences i had.

I learnt a lot from my errors and i promised myself i would do better next time. Around August, I got a message from the guy who introduced me to his bos  in Germany that i didn't pass his interview. The guy wanted me to build something amazing but he wasn't rich. I told him the amount you offering is for an intern. Since i was jobless, I decided to jump on the project. The project is interesting it involves having to reverse engineer some top social media apps of which i did in other to know how i could write mine. I got some hack about the project and i dived in.

To fully concentrate in his project, I resigned at the school i teach around september because i'm really not good at multitasking and also the work was becoming too demanding.

Focusing on the project was one the mistakes i made as i later noticed the guy dosen't really knows what he wants. I started doing the plan of project backend and implememting faetures only for the guy to come and say he wants it another way. It became painfull but i persevered.

There was a week national grid was down and i needed to complete a part of the web app as i would be giving a report on it the friday of that week so i decided to go to University of Ibadan to use power as i sure they are writing exams and the students would be provided other means of electricity. I got UI and i was disspointed as they had light. I worked all through the night and decided i needed to rest my head around 5:30 am. I was charging my phone right in front of me. I was dozing not knowing everyone that we spent the night together had left. I was still dozing and someone came him and picked my phone. not quite long after I woke up and noticed my phone was missing. It quickly rush downstairs to get someone tp ring my phone. My phone was ringing but no one picked. I was ringing the phone consistently until a man picked the phone and told me he would return the phone that was far away. I knew it was a lie as this is usually what they alter. Immediately i was thinking on how to get my sim blecked and every important information. I contacted my Mum that I would be coming to her place of to get transport fare to MTN office to retrieve my line. I did that almost immediately and started using an abandoned smartphone that was  in the house. This is an ugly experience for as i was at the end of the month i was told to halt work and wasn't paid a full salary.

I took up a tutorial job just to have some cash saved before going for NYSC. I did this and it really helped as I was independent akk through my camp in  Oyo state.
I really wanted a remote job that pays in USD so it wasn't much something
