Started the year with a lot of goals and aspirations in all aspects of life, including spiritual, career, and financial. It was a promising kick-off since the 2024 race had begun.

I had promised my boss (more like a brother) the previous year that I would work for him to build his software product to completion. On the 3rd day of January, I left Ibadan and traveled to Ile Ife to join my boss in developing the software. My plan was to complete the software project and dive straight into content creation with a focus on tech content. I felt this was the most lucrative path in tech and a quick way to gain recognition as a developer and, hopefully, secure a job.

I resumed working for my boss on the 8th of January, 2024. We were just two people on the project, so we handled both backend and frontend programming simultaneously. It was an interesting ride because it gave me the opportunity to implement exciting features. The goal was to ship the first version of the software by the first week of February, as my boss was running out of funds and urgently needed to acquire our first subscribers.

Working on the project was a significant learning experience for me. I developed a deep affection for it because it allowed me to explore advanced features of Node.js. The work continued day and night, and eventually, we needed to start designing frontend pages. Up until then, our frontend work had primarily been about sending important requests to the backend and receiving responses. Designing beautiful frontend pages became a pressing need.

My boss, being more of a backend developer, was not very accustomed to coding front-end designs. He had a habit of sourcing pre-coded designs and customizing them to meet his needs. For our project, he found all the pages from a website with a similar implementation and handed them to me to integrate into a React application.

As I began integrating these designs, I encountered a problem but was reluctant to inform him. I decided to code the pages from scratch instead of fixing the pre-designed ones. That’s where the problems began. After handing me the pages, my boss left for home to focus on resolving a backend issue—a part of the code was consuming too much memory, and the remote server we planned to deploy on had only 2GB of RAM. He worked on this issue for a week before finding a solution and returning to the office.

When he returned, he asked about the progress of the frontend designs. I told him I had completed only the landing page. He was upset, feeling I had been lazy since all I had to do was adapt the pre-coded designs. However, I felt I had done a lot of work because I had written the designs from scratch. These designs were complex, and implementing them manually required significant effort.

After explaining that I had encountered issues with the provided designs and opted to code them myself, we reviewed the problem together. We discovered that the pre-coded designs indeed had issues and wouldn’t work as intended. My boss decided we should manually create the designs, and this time, everything worked out fine.

On the morning of Wednesday, the 31st of January, 2024, I was rebellious to my boss’s instructions. As a result, he decided I shouldn’t continue working on his project. I was deeply sorry, but it was too late. It was a bad experience for me because I had developed a strong affection for the project. Despite my regret, I had to stop working on it.

While I stopped working, I started thinking about what to do next. I remembered that I needed to write some technical articles to be published on DEV.to, focusing on data structures and algorithms. I quickly dived into it, and it turned out to be a fascinating experience. From there, I realized I had developed a passion for explaining concepts. One of the topics I wrote about was Big O notation, a fundamental concept in data structures and algorithms, and my article was very detailed and explanatory.

After a week of being out of work, I decided to pack my luggage and return to Ibadan, going against my original plan. I couldn’t believe I was back home living with my parents. After two days of staying at home doing nothing, compounded by the lack of electricity to work on my laptop, I decided to head to the University of Ibadan to use their electricity. Upon arriving, my former roommate, who was pursuing his master’s degree there, asked me to help him with a software project assessment he needed to complete for graduation from his online tech school. I jumped at the opportunity since I didn’t have any other projects to work on—I just wanted to write code.

The amazing part was how engrossed I became in the project. It was a blog app, and I worked on it tirelessly throughout the day until I realized it was late at night, too late to go home. It was only when someone asked me to check the time that I realized how much time had passed. Although I hadn’t finished the project, I promised to continue the next day. As I prepared to leave, I discovered I couldn’t go home because it was already too late. I called a friend of my boss, who was also pursuing his master’s degree at the University of Ibadan, and asked if I could stay the night at his place. He obliged, but since he wasn’t around, his roommate came to pick me up. I stayed in their room and slept.

At around 6 AM, I woke up and headed back to the Student Union Building to continue working on the project. I coded all day, and eventually, my former roommate offered me a spot in his room since he had an empty bed. I gladly accepted because, with no electricity at home, there was no point in going back. During that period, I wrote a lot of code, which made me feel like I had to succeed this year. I used my roommate’s laptop, which had a longer battery life and 16GB of RAM, making work much faster and more enjoyable. I became so familiar with his system that I started to feel the need to upgrade my laptop’s RAM to enhance its capacity.

After completing a significant milestone in the project for three consecutive days of work, I decided to take a break and return home. I promised to come back in two days. On my way home, I couldn’t stop thinking about how to quickly get a job that would allow me to upgrade my laptop’s RAM capacity to 16GB of RAM. I concluded that finding a teaching job would be a good option. Teaching jobs were usually easy to find, and I hoped to get one at a school with a constant power supply where I could charge my laptop and work during my free periods.

I decided to take a bold step and apply to one of the best schools in the area, a school with the facilities I wanted, to see if they needed a teacher. At the time, the term was almost over, and under normal circumstances, they wouldn’t need a new teacher. Unknown to me, a teacher had just left and they needed to fill the vacant position. I was invited to take an exam the following week.

I wrote the exam and was subsequently called for an interview. I performed well, and by the end of February, I was informed that I could resume work in the first week of March. I was thrilled because this job would allow me to save part of my salary to buy the RAM upgrade for my system, which I had been eagerly planning. I taught the students diligently, and they liked me because I was the youngest and most approachable teacher at the school. 

The school typically closed by 3:30 PM, but I noticed that the principal often stayed late to handle administrative work. I discovered the school library was one of the few places where I could code without distractions. I seized this opportunity to stay back, code, and charge my laptop. Most days, I left the school around 7 PM, long after official activities ended. I was working on a personal project that I believed could significantly improve my financial situation.

By April, I received my salary and purchased the additional RAM. Also, I completed the personal project I was working on, and everything was functioning well. However, I wanted an extra feature that wasn’t in my control. I decided to use an API to get this feature done, but I soon discovered that the API i was intergrating into the project wasn’t entirely reliable. This setback made me lose hope in the project temporarily.

During the school holidays in April, I focused on researching better APIs while still visiting the school to access electricity for charging my laptop. Eventually, I found another API that could implement the feature. Unfortunately, when I attempted to integrate it into my application, it didn’t work as expected.

While trying to solve this issue, I received a call from a friend who asked if I could recommend someone to work on a frontend project. Normally, I didn’t specialize in frontend development, but I needed the extra income, so I took the job. My friend connected me to the project owner, an honorable gentleman, and we discussed the details. He sent me the Figma prototype, which included an animated page.

We agreed on a price and deadline, and I told him I would complete the project within two weeks. The truth was, I could finish it in four days, but I didn’t trust Electricity supply and wanted to give myself some breathing room. I worked on the project leisurely, and two days before the deadline, I hosted it for the client to review. Apart from a few minor corrections, everything was complete, and I delivered the final project on time.

With the payment from the project, I felt a strong conviction to use the money for something I hadn’t originally planned. I followed my instincts and used it in a way that brought me fulfillment. Meanwhile, I continued working at the school and coding on my laptop daily. It was an interesting and fulfilling routine.

Fast forward to June, we had a mid-term break at school, and I decided to go to the University of Ibadan (UI) to access electricity since no one would be available at school. I was entirely focused on achieving my financial goal for the first half of the year. I worked tirelessly, spending three consecutive days without bathing or brushing my teeth, glued to my laptop. I was relentlessly applying for opportunities on various freelance platforms.

On Saturday evening, I left UI and returned home to prepare for church the following day, which also happened to be Sallah. On Sunday afternoon after i was back from church, I decided to check my LinkedIn account. To my surprise, I found a gig opportunity that could help me achieve my financial goal for the first half of the year. Excitedly, I applied through email and got a response.

The hiring team scheduled an interview for the next day. When the day arrived, I completed the interview, and the interviewer informed me that I had been shortlisted for the final round. I was scheduled to meet with the CEO on Friday. He also advised me to prepare thoroughly for cloud computing questions, particularly focusing on AWS. I felt somewhat confident, as I had previously worked with some AWS services, though I wasn’t deeply experienced.

On Friday, the day of the interview, I met the CEO, a Nigerian based in Germany. After introducing myself, the conversation started smoothly. His first question was about deploying an application to AWS EC2. I was shocked because i was only experienced using AWS Lambda. He reassured me it was okay and moved on to the next question. Unfortunately, I misunderstood his second question, prompting him to rephrase it for clarity. Once clarified, I was able to answer correctly. However, the third question took me a long time to respond to, and the CEO wrongly assumed I was searching for the answer during the interview. Due to this, he decided to discontinue the interview, stating that he could not proceed with awarding me the gig.

I was devastated. Missing out on that gig meant I couldn’t meet my financial goal for the first half of the year. It was a tough and disappointing experience, and one of the low points of my journey.

I learned a lot from my past mistakes and promised myself that I would do better next time. Around August, I received a message from the same person who had previously introduced me to the Nigerian CEO based in Germany, whose interview I didn’t pass. This time, he wanted me to build something amazing. However, the amount he was offering was relatively low. When I mentioned this, he clarified that it was just an internship.

Since I was unemployed and wanted to explore reverse engineering some of the apps that had features similar to what he wanted, I decided to take on the project. I found some interesting hacks related to the project and dove right in. To fully concentrate on the project, I resigned from the teaching job around September, as I’m not great at multitasking. Moreover, the project was highly demanding.

Focusing solely on this project turned out to be one of the ugliest mistakes I made. I later realized that the client didn’t have a clear vision of what he wanted. I ended up serving as both the software architect and the tech lead for the project. I meticulously planned the algorithms and solutions, but he frequently suggested alternative approaches that weren’t robust. I would explain to him that I had carefully considered the trade-offs and benefits of my solutions, but he often prioritized speed over quality. It was frustrating, but I persevered.

In the middle of October, the national power grid went down, and I urgently needed to complete a section of the web app to present a progress report that Friday. To access electricity, I went to the University of Ibadan (UI). Fortunately, they had power. I worked tirelessly through the night, and by around 5:30 AM, I decided to take a short break while my phone was charging in front of me. Feeling comfortable, I rested my head for a moment. Unfortunately, I fell into a deep sleep.

When I woke up around 6:15 AM, I discovered that my phone had been stolen. Those 45 minutes felt like the ugliest and most distressing moments of my life. Panicking, I tried every possible way to locate the phone, knowing it was likely still on campus. I rushed downstairs to ask someone to call my phone. It rang, but no one answered. After persistent dialing, a man finally picked up and claimed he would return the phone but said he was far away. I immediately knew he was lying—this is a common excuse thieves use.

At that moment, I began to worry about my SIM card being misused for any fraudulent or dangerous activities. I quickly visited my network provider’s office and retrieve my line. I completed the SIM replacement almost immediately and resorted to using an old, abandoned smartphone I found at home.

This ugly experience marked the end of my habit of moving around in search of electricity. The project’s progress slowed significantly after that incident. By the end of the month, I wasn’t paid a full salary and was informed that the work would be halted due to a lack of funding from investors.

In November, I decided it was time to go for NYSC, something I had been avoiding because I felt it was a waste of time. While waiting for NYSC registration to begin, I took up a tutorial job introduced to me by my sister's friend in my neighborhood. I thought it would be a good way to earn some cash.

The job turned out to be quite enjoyable, and I liked the flexibility of the per-hour arrangement, as it gave me the freedom to focus on other activities.

While working at the tutorial, I was discussing my intended NYSC posting with my sister's friend at the tutorial center. He advised me to reconsider my choice of location, saying that serving in that part of the country might not be worth it. Curious, I turned to Google for research and reached out to people who had served there. Their opinions were unanimous—they all discouraged serving in that area.

After careful thought, I decided to pick the state where I already lived. It felt like a more practical choice since I wouldn’t have to deal with the hassle of moving my belongings around.

When NYSC registration began, I did everything possible to ensure I registered with the batch. Everything worked out perfectly, and I was posted to the state where I reside. I had always dreaded the NYSC orientation camp, but my mum encouraged me to embrace the experience. To my surprise, camp turned out to be an exciting chapter. I met a lot of people and genuinely enjoyed the activities.

When camp ended, I returned home to a festive atmosphere as the Christmas season was already in full swing.

As I reflect on 2024, I’m filled with gratitude for the good, the bad, and the ugly experiences I’ve encountered. it’s clear that life is a blend of ups and downs, each experience shaping and teaching valuable lessons. From missed opportunities and challenging projects to moments of resilience and personal growth, every phase served a purpose. The year was not without its struggle but it was also filled with achievements, new beginnings, and meaningful connections.

Through it all, I learned the importance of perseverance, adaptability, and gratitude. Each challenge was an opportunity to grow, and each triumph was a reminder of what’s possible with hard work and faith. 

2024 may not have been perfect, but it was significant, and for that, I am deeply thankful. Here’s to embracing the new year with optimism, courage, and a commitment to becoming even better.
